#4. Create a variable × with value of 10
'''
x = 10
'''
#5. Increase × value by 15 using assignment operators
'''
x +=15

'''
#6. Divide the × value by 5 using assignment operators
'''
x = 10/2
'''
#7. Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operator
'''
x = 5*2
'''
#8. Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
'''
x=2
y=1
x+=y
'''
#9. Using python print the module of 11 to 4
'''
x=11%4
print (x)
'''
#10. Print the exponent of 2,3
'''
x=2**3
print (x)
